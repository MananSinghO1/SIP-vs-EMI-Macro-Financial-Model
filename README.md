# 📈 SIP vs EMI: Macro-Driven Financial Decision Model

## 🧠 About the Project
This macro-enabled Excel model is designed to evaluate the long-term financial trade-offs between investing via Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) and asset acquisition through Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs). It offers a data-driven simulation of real-world behavioral finance scenarios, enabling users to test personalized investment journeys based on tenure, interest rates, asset values, and SIP returns. 

The goal: empower smarter capital allocation decisions backed by dynamic forecasting, scenario visualization, and clear break-even logic — all built within a self-contained Excel framework with macro automation.
